# Inventory-Mannagement-System
### Question
Consider the single period model with C 0 = Re 1; Cs = Rs 19 per unit and I = 1.12 units. The demand density function is given by f(D) = f(D) = De ^(-D). The cost of carrying inventory if left after the period is Re 1 per unit.
Simulate the system for 50 days and estimate the mean number of papers should he order each day.
### Assumptions
1.	Reorder point of the inventory is 0 units i.e. a new order is placed when the inventory level reaches 0 units.
2.	Lead time is 0 i.e. stock replenishment takes instantaneously as on soon as the order is placed.
3.	Maximum inventory level is assumed to be 2 units. Replenishment of stock is accomplished using (0,2) policy i.e. whenever the inventory level reaches 0 units, a quantity is ordered so that the inventory reaches a maximum level of 2 units. 
4.	No back ordering is allowed.
